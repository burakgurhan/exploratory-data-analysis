# exploratory-data-analysis
This is an exploratory data analysis for keywords in the electronics category of Amazon. 
The project aims to explore features of the most searched keywords in a certain category.
It helps sellers to better understand the metrics of keywords, such as Fulfillment types, Size Tiers, mean prices, and reviews. 
This may be helpful for all types of Amazon sellers like private label, arbitrage, and wholesale sellers.

The data is sourced from the Blackbox keyword research tool of Hellium10. I select the keywords only for the electronics category and start downloading in descending order.
It is estimated data and does not reflect real data. I did this EDA for educational purposes.
